# Telegram Mini Apps Toolkit

## Why

Official Telegram SDK sucks. Here is why.

### Old-fashioned way

old style coding, technologies, IIFE

### Not-minified

### No package

### Unreadable code

open source is great, because code quality will eventually increase as other developers start to find weaknesses in your code.
